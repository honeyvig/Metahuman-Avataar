# Metahuman-Avataar
We are seeking a skilled developer or team to build an AI-driven mobile application MVP designed for a highly interactive, emotionally intelligent user experience. This application will feature a Metahuman avatar that enables users to engage in natural, responsive conversations, as well as an integrated digital twin modeling feature that simulates the user’s health based on personalized inputs.

Key Project Elements:
Metahuman Character: Develop a Metahuman avatar with expressive facial animations and upper body gestures to create a lifelike, engaging user interface.

Emotionally Responsive Voice: Integrate customizable voice capabilities, using technology such as Eleven Labs, to convey a range of emotions, enhancing the human-like experience.

Human-like Animations: Implement realistic facial and upper body animations that respond dynamically to user interactions.

Digital Twin Modeling: Build a digital twin system based on users' biometric and lifestyle data inputs, providing a real-time health simulation that enhances personalized insights.

AI Model Integration: Integrate a customized GPT-4 model for intelligent, context-aware, and emotionally responsive interactions; the model will be enhanced by data from Claude to refine conversational depth and relevance.

Multi-language Support: Ensure the application supports multiple languages, initially focusing on English, AAVE, and possibly Spanish, with accurate lip-syncing and facial animations for realistic interactions.

Application Specifications:
Platform: Compatible with both iOS and Android, featuring a cohesive design for both platforms.
User Input: Accepts both text and voice prompts, with responses delivered as on-screen text and articulated through the Metahuman avatar.
Scalability: Supports simultaneous usage by 25-50 users, scalable up to 100 users with a daily session limit of 60 minutes per user for quality assurance.
Completion Goal: Full project completion is targeted for the end of November, ensuring robust functionality and quality standards.
This app is designed to emulate real human interaction with a focus on emotional intelligence and digital twin modeling to deliver an experience that’s both immersive and health-focused, supporting users’ wellness goals in a truly personalized way.
------------------
Creating an AI-driven mobile application MVP as described requires integrating various technologies and frameworks. Below is an outline of how you can structure the project, along with Python code snippets where applicable. Given the complexity, the implementation would typically involve multiple teams, including mobile developers, AI specialists, and UX/UI designers.
Project Structure
1. Metahuman Avatar Development

You would typically use Unreal Engine for developing Metahuman avatars, but Python can be used to manage data and APIs.

python

# Example of importing and managing avatar data
import unreal

# Load your Metahuman avatar in Unreal Engine
def load_metahuman_avatar(avatar_name):
    avatar = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.load_asset(f'/Game/Metahumans/{avatar_name}.{avatar_name}')
    return avatar

2. Emotionally Responsive Voice Integration

For voice synthesis, you could use Eleven Labs API. Here's a simple example of how to send a request to generate audio:

python

import requests

def generate_voice(text):
    url = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech"
    payload = {
        "text": text,
        "voice": "your_voice_model",  # Specify the voice model you want
    }
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.content  # This should return the audio data

3. Human-like Animations

Implement animations using a game engine or animation framework. If using Unreal Engine, you would handle animations within the game logic.

python

# Trigger an animation in Unreal
def play_animation(avatar, animation_name):
    animation = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.load_asset(f'/Game/Animations/{animation_name}.{animation_name}')
    avatar.play_animation(animation)

4. Digital Twin Modeling

To create a digital twin, you would need to collect user biometric data and simulate health outcomes based on that data.

python

import json

def simulate_health(biometric_data):
    # Example: Process biometric data and generate health insights
    simulated_health_data = {
        "heart_rate": biometric_data["heart_rate"] * 0.9,  # Simulate some changes
        "blood_pressure": biometric_data["blood_pressure"] - 10,
        # Add more simulated parameters
    }
    return json.dumps(simulated_health_data)

5. AI Model Integration

Integrate a GPT-4 model for conversational capabilities. You can utilize OpenAI's API:

python

import openai

def get_ai_response(user_input):
    openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

6. Multi-language Support

Implement translation using a service like Google Cloud Translation API.

python

from google.cloud import translate_v2 as translate

def translate_text(text, target_language):
    translate_client = translate.Client()
    translation = translate_client.translate(text, target_lang=target_language)
    return translation['translatedText']

7. Mobile Application Framework

For mobile development, consider using a framework like React Native or Flutter. You can call your Python backend APIs from the mobile app.
Application Deployment

    Server: Use a cloud provider like AWS or Azure to host your APIs.
    Database: Store user data and application states using a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
    CI/CD Pipeline: Use GitHub Actions or similar tools to automate testing and deployment.

Conclusion

This is a high-level overview and basic implementation of components needed for your AI-driven mobile application. Each part would require more detailed development and integration work, often involving teams of specialists. For completion by the end of November, you would need to ensure efficient project management and clear communication between all team members involved.
